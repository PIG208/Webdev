            <h1>Reflection on <i>As We May Think</i> by Vannevar Bush and <i>Long Live the Web</i> by Tim-bernas Lee</h1>

            <p>When I first started reading <em>As We May Think</em> by Vannevar Bush, I wasn’t aware of the fact that this was published way back in 1945, at least not until I got to the part on photography. Vannevar describes “the future”, A.K.A. the present of ours, in an alienated, yet imaginative way. Some of his educated guesses on the future of technologies are somewhat accurate. We do have “dry photography” now, and it’s also a lot faster, just like how Vannevar would expect. We do have a “memex”, which is the Internet.</p>
            <p>It is shockingly surprising to see how the artificial concepts exactly map to some objects we have today: the desk with a translucent screen and a keyboard is basically a computer, the way one would lookup a book in memex is like using a search engine, a trail is like a webpage with links to other interconnected resources! Vannevar creates a sketchy blueprint for the Internet, with the state-of-art technologies at hand. It is funny to see how the Internet built with microfilms, books, levers connected to complex machinery. This reminds me of those steampunk art work in which steam powered rocket science is the mainstream – awkward in a sense, but still quite reasonable.</p>
            <p>While Vannevar drafted a baby version of the Internet, Tim Bernars-Lee was concerning about the Internet’s social responsibilities in his article <em>Long Live the Web</em>. The reoccurring theme of this article is <b>freedom</b>. Decentralization, free-to-use web infrastructure, open standards and ecosystems, rejection of traffic discrimination, anti-snooping, and free speech are all in common. These are practices to ensure that the web belongs to everyone, and it should be kept free by all means.</p>
